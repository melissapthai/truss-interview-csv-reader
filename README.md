# Truss Interview: CSV Reader
This is a Python command line tool that reads a CSV formatted file on `stdin` and emits a normalized CSV formatted file on `stdout`. A full description of the problem is [here](https://github.com/trussworks/truss-interview/blob/main/CSV_README.md).

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/melissapthai/truss-interview-csv-reader.git
```
2. Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies.
```
make setup
```
3. Run the program with the desired input and output CSV files.
```
python3 normalizer.py < sample.csv > output.csv
```

And that's it!
